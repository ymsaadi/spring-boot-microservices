# E-Commerce Spring Boot Microservices

Welcome to the E-Commerce Spring Boot Microservices project! This comprehensive system is designed to streamline and enhance the E-commerce experience through a set of interconnected microservices.

## Overview
This project comprises multiple microservices, each catering to specific functionalities within the E-commerce ecosystem:

1. **Product Service:** Manages product information, allowing the creation, retrieval, and modification of product details.

2. **Order Service:** Facilitates order processing, enabling users to place orders, view order history, and receive order notifications.

3. **Inventory Service:** Handles inventory management, ensuring real-time updates on product availability and stock levels.

4. **Notification Service:** Manages notifications, such as order confirmations and updates, enhancing user communication.

## Features
* **Microservices Architecture:** Utilizes a microservices-based architecture for improved scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

* **Asynchronous Communication with Kafka:** Implements Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring real-time updates.

* **Fault Tolerance with Resilience4J:** Enhances system robustness by implementing Resilience4J for circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries.

* **Security with Spring Security:** Implements Spring Security for secure communication within the Eureka Server and API Gateway.

* **Dynamic Routing with Spring Cloud Gateway:** Configures Spring Cloud Gateway for efficient and dynamic routing between microservices.

* **Client Load Balancing:** Enables client load balancing in the order service for enhanced system performance.

* **Integration with Eureka Discovery Server:** Incorporates Netflix Eureka Discovery Server for efficient service registration and discovery.

* **Real-time Inventory Checks:** Ensures real-time communication between the Order Service and Inventory Service to validate product availability.
